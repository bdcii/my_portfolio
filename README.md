# my_portfolio

## Intro

This is my second homework assignment for my coding bootcamp.  I am to make a website/portfolio to advertise myself for potential employers.


## Work

The Work section displays some of the coding projects I have worked on.  Since I am still working on building my portfolio, most of these links are dead and serve only as placeholders.  I will update the links and corresponding images as I complete new projects.


## Contact Me

This section lists my phone number, email address, and GitHub page.  I will add more relevant information as I update the website over time.
